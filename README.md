## Repository Structure

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To edit or compile the CV, you will need:
- **LaTeX distribution** (such as TeX Live or MiKTeX)
- **LaTeX editor** (optional, but helpful; options include Overleaf, TeXShop, or TeXworks)

### Compiling the CV

To compile the LaTeX source file into a PDF:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/simonpierreboucher/CV.git
   cd CV
   ```

2. Run `pdflatex` (or your preferred LaTeX compiler) on the `.tex` file:

   ```bash
   pdflatex CV_2024_09_05.tex
   ```

This will generate an updated PDF file in the repository directory.

## Customization

The LaTeX source file (`CV_2024_09_05.tex`) is structured to make customization straightforward:
- **Content**: Update sections within the `.tex` file to reflect any new experience, skills, or other details.
- **Formatting**: The `resume.cls` file controls the CV's styling. Adjust this file if you want to change the layout, fonts, or section formatting.
